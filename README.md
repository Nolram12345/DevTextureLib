# DevTextureLib
A small library of various CC0 textures and surface imperfections, mainly as placeholder for graphics development.
Feel free to create pull requests to add more - however they MUST ALL BE YOUR OWN and under a CC0 license.

**Get the latest and in-development packages from** [here]https://packages.noxity-games.com/open-source/devtexturelib/

All textures are 4k PNG textures. "Regular textures" (so nothing like surface imperfections) are in the metallic/roughness PBR format (support for other formats coming soon, see [#4](/../../issues/4) ).
