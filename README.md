# DevTextureLib
A small library of various CC0 textures and surface imperfections, mainly as placeholder for graphics development.

All textures are 4k PNG textures. "Regular textures" (so no channel-specific textures like surface imperfections) are in the metallic/roughness PBR format (support for other formats coming soon, see [#4](/../../issues/4) ).
